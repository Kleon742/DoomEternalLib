# DoomEternalLib
A collection of reverse-engineered type informations from Doom Eternal.

While most of the data is reorganized to transform it into readable C++ code, the compilation of said header files is not guaranteed in any way. The purpose of the dump's existence is to aid future research.

Classes lack virtual function declarations, unfortunately, and compile-time used variables are not present either, sadly. Despite these limitations in the data dump, the amount of information gained from this should not be underappreciated, in my opinion.

This repository is part of an article from my website www.kleon.cc.
Have fun.
